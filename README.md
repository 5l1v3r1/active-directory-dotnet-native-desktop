# Integrating Azure AD into a Windows desktop application using interactive authentication

 **There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform** (formerly Azure AD v2.0) and MSAL.NET. 
 
 Check it out: https://github.com/azure-samples/ms-identity-dotnet-desktop-msgraph.

 If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0 | ADAL.NET sample, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-native-desktop/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
